## Enjoy & Share!
- 👋 Hi, I'm yuan, a graduate student learning causal inference in China.
- 👀I'm interested in psychology.  Psychology is not a technique to read mind, but a way to live a better life. Besides, I love creating. Creating itself is satisfied enough, whatever the result. And this github.io is one of my work. Enjoy what we are doing, and share our ideas.
Oh, specifically, I love singing, though in a primary level. And I like reading in my spare time, and swimming, and so on.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning singing, and explore different kinds of music, rocks currently.

- 💞️I'm looking to collarborate with people with open mind. Let's exchange our ideas and create new ideas!
